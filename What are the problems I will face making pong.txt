For pong to work, I need to create a window. 
- I will use NCURSES to make a simple terminal game.
- I need to know the velocity of the ball (base velocity)
- Knowing the velocity, I will know how much time it takes to cross the screen
- Does the ball have both vertical and horizontal velocity? Yes. How does this interact with the
  paddles? The paddle velocity?
- Something to keep track of the score.
- Something to keep track of the time remaining. How long will a round be?
- Game modes of best of 3 or 5 rounds. 
- Controls
- The computer, program the CPU player. How to make it beatable? Can't be perfect, needs flaws but 
  needs to be somewhat competent or game is unplayable. Vary difficulty throughout the game? How 
  "responsive" and "clinical" the computer is as it's played against.
- Create a simple menu with the options "Play" and "Exit" with a simple title and graphic of Pong and   an ascii circle.
-Use mersenne twister for PRNG.
